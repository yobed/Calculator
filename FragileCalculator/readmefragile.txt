This project was created in a team of 4 other students,
in which we used scrum and git to work together,
fix problems together, and create together.

Overall we finished the calculator with multiple functions
such as Language, TypeSetting, Color, Webpage (Offline), and etc.

I mostly worked on the GUI, type-setting, and some other odd things
like the functioning of buttons, etc.
